# Diaspora: User Directory Bot

This is a Telegram bot for communities of expats and emigrants.  Such communities typically have specific needs such as services in their native language, certain goods that are not typical for the place, etc.

The bot runs in a chat, and maintains a database of users of the chat who could address these specific needs of the community by providing these special services.  This database is populated by these chat members, and is then available to all users of the chat.

For example, some chat member might be a hairdresser that speaks the language of the chat.  Another person knows a lot about how the immigration office works in this city, and can help with advice.  They talk to the bot and say what they do and where they are located.  Others may then ask the bot about services available in the location, and they will see users who registered their services.
